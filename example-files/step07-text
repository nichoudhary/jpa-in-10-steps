###### Section 7 - Introduction to JPA | Step 07 - Using a Command Line to Save User to DB

After defining all of the things in the previous step, we'd want to call this DAO service in some place. One of the things
that we've already setup is a simple project which launches up a spring context. As this project is created using Spring Boot
and Spring Boot Starter, this is already starting something called the spring context. At the launch of the Spring Context,
we'd want to insert a user in. How do we do that? Theres's a concept called Command Line Runner. This command line runners
are typically executed when the spring context launches up i.e. when the application starts up. So, let's create a simple
command line runner.

New class -> UserDaoServiceCommandLineRunner
For this class to be managed by Spring -> @Component
To make it a command line runner -> implements a interface -> UserDaoServiceCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner
To save the user to the DB -> implement the run method with the required logic

Let's use logger to log the id of the created user.

After all this, now when we re-start the application, we can see in the logs
-> New User is Created : User{id=1, name='Jack', role='Admin'}

The thing which we need to understand here is the fact that we haven't created a DB yet. How is this magic happening?
Where is this data getting stored? Where is the database present? We'll see about this in the next step.
