###### Section 7 - Introduction to JPA | Step 10 - More JPA Repository: findById and findAll

Spring Data JPA makes it easy to manage all your entities. Once you've defined your entities and defined the mapping to the
database. That's it! Spring data repository would provide a lot of useful methods to manage them. Let's look into other
methods provided by JPA (we have already looked into userRepository.save)

1. userRepository.findById(Long ID) -> This returns an optional<T> from DB matching the id
2. userRepository.findAll() -> This returns all the present list from DB

There are a lot of other methods which we can play around with.
